> Additionally, this theme is designed to be fairly resiliant to altering the accent colour. It is less resiliant for changing to be a light theme, but if you feel up to the work, go ahead!

# Wanna help me out???

I went through a boss room or two and now I'm stuck with the perma-debuffs "depressed", "capitalism", and "caffeine-dependant". So if you wanna help me out, you can throw some Ameri-bucks my way on my kofi: [https://ko-fi.com/queenofsquiggles](https://ko-fi.com/queenofsquiggles)
